## ABC
Abc is online code editor with syntax highlighter, hotkeys and other features.
[Demo](https://nmalcev.github.io/abc/)

Main features:
- HTML code execution;
- JS code execution;
- SVG viewer;
- Markdown viewer.

### About
Abc doesn't have any dependencies. The project was created for educational purposes. And I achieved my childhood dream of writing my own text editor.
Abc supports code execution and is close to [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/) or [Jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
All projects can be exported to a separate file and imported to another device.
The current version of the application has partial support for the markdown file format.

### Commands
To build the project, you must run the following command:
``` 
$ npm run build
$ npm run build:styles
```
The `static/app/build` folder will contain the executable application. 


npm run bundle
npm run serve
